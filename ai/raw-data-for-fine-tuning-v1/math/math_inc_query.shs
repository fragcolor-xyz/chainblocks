  solution: """
    0 >= mutable-var

    1
    Math.Inc(mutable-var)

    mutable-var
    Log("result")

    Math.Inc(Value: mutable-var)

    Get(mutable-var)
    Log(Prefix: "result" Level: LogLevel::Info)
  """

  explanation: """
    Math.Inc is a Maths Shard that will take a in inputs with numeric value and increase the mutable variable passed into Value parameter by said amount.
    Unlike Math.Add which is a binary operation, Math.Inc is a unary operation.
