	Here's an example of how you can generate a 6x6 hexagonal grid using d-BlockHexagon tiles in Shards:

```csharp
using Shards.Tiles;
using Shards.Tiles.Hexagon;
using UnityEngine;

public class HexagonalGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int gridSize = 6;
    public float tileSize = 1f;

    private void Start()
    {
        GenerateHexagonalGrid();
    }

    private void GenerateHexagonalGrid()
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < gridSize; x++)
        {
            for (int z = 0; z < gridSize; z++)
            {
                float xPos = (x + (z % 2 * 0.5f)) * tileSize * 0.866f;
                float zPos = z * tileSize * 1.5f;
                Vector3 position = new Vector3(xPos, -1.0f, zPos);

                var tile = TileFactory.CreateTile<d_BlockHexagon>(position, Quaternion.identity);
                tile.transform.SetParent(transform);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening in the code:

1. The `GenerateHexagonalGrid()` method is responsible for creating the 6x6 hexagonal grid.
2. We use a nested loop to iterate through the grid size (6x6).
3. For each tile, we calculate the x and z positions based on the current loop indices and the `tileSize` variable.
4. The x position is offset by `(x + (z % 2 * 0.5f)) * tileSize * 0.866f`, which shifts the odd rows by half a tile width.
5. The z position is calculated as `z * tileSize * 1.5f`, which is the standard spacing for a hexagonal grid.
6. The y position is set to `-1.0f` to keep the tiles at the same y-axis level.
7. We then use the `TileFactory.CreateTile<d_BlockHexagon>()` method to create a new d-BlockHexagon tile at the calculated position.
8. Finally, we set the newly created tile as a child of the `transform` of the `HexagonalGrid` object.

This code will generate a 6x6 hexagonal grid of d-BlockHexagon tiles, with the tiles offset in the x and z axes to form a cohesive hexagonal pattern.
