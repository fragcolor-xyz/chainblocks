	To generate a 6x6 hexagonal grid using d-BlockHexagon tiles with the y-axis at -1.0 and offsetting the tile's x position by 0.5 and z position by 0.865, you can use the following code:

```python
import math

# Set the size of the hexagonal grid
grid_size = 6

# Set the y-axis position
y_pos = -1.0

# Set the offset values for x and z positions
x_offset = 0.5
z_offset = 0.865

# Generate the hexagonal grid
for row in range(grid_size):
    for col in range(grid_size):
        # Calculate the x and z positions based on the row and column
        x_pos = col * (1 + x_offset)
        z_pos = row * z_offset

        # Adjust the x position for odd rows
        if row % 2 != 0:
            x_pos += (1 + x_offset) / 2

        # Create the d-BlockHexagon tile at the calculated position
        d_BlockHexagon(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos)
```

Explanation:
1. We set the size of the hexagonal grid using the `grid_size` variable, which determines the number of rows and columns in the grid.

2. We set the y-axis position using the `y_pos` variable, which is set to -1.0 in this case.

3. We define the offset values for the x and z positions using the `x_offset` and `z_offset` variables. The `x_offset` is set to 0.5, and the `z_offset` is set to 0.865.

4. We start a nested loop to iterate over each row and column in the grid.

5. Inside the loop, we calculate the x and z positions for each tile based on the current row and column.
   - The x position is calculated by multiplying the column index by `(1 + x_offset)`.
   - The z position is calculated by multiplying the row index by `z_offset`.

6. For odd rows, we adjust the x position by adding half of `(1 + x_offset)` to create the staggered arrangement of the hexagonal grid.

7. Finally, we create the d-BlockHexagon tile at the calculated x, y, and z positions using the `d_BlockHexagon()` function.

This code will generate a 6x6 hexagonal grid of d-BlockHexagon tiles with the specified y-axis position and offset values for the x and z positions. The tiles will form a cohesive hexagonal grid pattern.
