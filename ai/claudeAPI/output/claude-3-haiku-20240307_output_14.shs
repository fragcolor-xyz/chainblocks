	To generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid using d-BlockSnowHexagon tiles, starting from x position 4 and z position 4, with a y-axis of -1.0, you can use the following Shards code:

```csharp
// Set the starting position
float startX = 4f;
float startZ = 4f;
float y = -1.0f;

// Iterate through the grid
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
    {
        // Calculate the tile position
        float tileX = startX + (j * 0.5f);
        float tileZ = startZ + (i * 0.865f);

        // Create the d-BlockSnowHexagon tile
        d_BlockSnowHexagon tile = new d_BlockSnowHexagon();
        tile.transform.position = new Vector3(tileX, y, tileZ);
        tile.transform.rotation = Quaternion.identity;

        // Add the tile to the scene
        tile.AddToScene();
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We set the starting position for the grid using the `startX` and `startZ` variables.
2. We set the y-axis to `-1.0f`.
3. We use two nested loops to iterate through the 4x4 grid.
4. For each iteration, we calculate the tile position using the following formula:
   - `tileX = startX + (j * 0.5f)`: This offsets the x-position of each tile by 0.5 to create the hexagonal grid.
   - `tileZ = startZ + (i * 0.865f)`: This offsets the z-position of each tile by 0.865 to create the hexagonal grid.
5. We create a new `d_BlockSnowHexagon` tile and set its position using the calculated `tileX`, `y`, and `tileZ` values.
6. We set the tile's rotation to `Quaternion.identity` (no rotation).
7. Finally, we add the tile to the scene using the `AddToScene()` method.

This code will generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid of d-BlockSnowHexagon tiles, with the tiles offset by 0.5 in the x-axis and 0.865 in the z-axis to create the hexagonal pattern.
