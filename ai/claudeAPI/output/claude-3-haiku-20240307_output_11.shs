	Here's the Shards code to generate 6 trees spread randomly on a 3x3 grid using the `d-TreePine` prefab, starting from an x and z position of 1.0 and keeping the y-axis at 0.0:

```csharp
using Shards;
using UnityEngine;

public class TreeGenerator : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject treePrefab;
    private float gridSize = 3f;
    private float startPosition = 1f;

    void Start()
    {
        GenerateTrees();
    }

    void GenerateTrees()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
        {
            float x = startPosition + Random.Range(0f, gridSize - 1f);
            float z = startPosition + Random.Range(0f, gridSize - 1f);
            Vector3 position = new Vector3(x, 0f, z);
            Instantiate(treePrefab, position, Quaternion.identity);
        }
    }
}
```

Here's how the code works:

1. The `TreeGenerator` class has a public `treePrefab` variable to hold the `d-TreePine` prefab.
2. The `gridSize` variable is set to 3, representing the 3x3 grid.
3. The `startPosition` variable is set to 1, which will be the starting x and z position for the trees.
4. In the `Start()` method, the `GenerateTrees()` method is called.
5. The `GenerateTrees()` method uses a `for` loop to create 6 trees.
6. Inside the loop, a random x and z position is generated within the 3x3 grid, using the `startPosition` and `gridSize` variables.
7. The y-axis is set to 0.0 to keep the trees on the ground.
8. The `d-TreePine` prefab is then instantiated at the generated position.

When you run this code, it will create 6 trees randomly placed on a 3x3 grid, with the trees starting at an x and z position of 1.0 and the y-axis set to 0.0.
