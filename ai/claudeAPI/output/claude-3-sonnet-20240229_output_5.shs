	```shards
0 >= idx
ForRange(0 5 {
  idx | ToFloat | Math.Divide(3.0) | Math.Floor = x
  idx | Math.Mod(3) | ToFloat = z
  @f3(x 0.0 z) = position
  {Graphics: {"fbl/pose": {translation: position rotation: @f4(0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) scale: @f3(1.0)}}} | Fbl.Formalize("d-treeDefault")
  Math.Inc(idx)
})
```

This script spawns 6 trees in a 3x2 grid pattern. It uses a loop to iterate 6 times, calculating the x and z positions based on the loop index. It then creates a translation vector with those positions and uses Fbl.Formalize to spawn a tree entity from the "d-treeDefault" asset at that position.
