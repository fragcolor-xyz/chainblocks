	Here's an example of how you can generate 10 flowers spread randomly on a 2x2 grid using d-FlowerRed, starting from x and z position of 1.0 and keeping the y-axis at 0.0:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let x = rng.gen_range(1.0..3.0);
        let z = rng.gen_range(1.0..3.0);

        d-FlowerRed(
            position: (x, 0.0, z),
            rotation: (0.0, rng.gen_range(0.0..360.0), 0.0),
            scale: (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
        );
    }
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. We import the `rand` crate to generate random numbers.
2. We create a new thread-local random number generator `rng` using `rand::thread_rng()`.
3. We use a `for` loop to generate 10 flowers.
4. Inside the loop, we generate random `x` and `z` coordinates within the range of 1.0 to 3.0 using `rng.gen_range(1.0..3.0)`. This ensures that the flowers are placed within the 2x2 grid, starting from 1.0 on both axes.
5. We keep the `y` coordinate at 0.0 for all flowers.
6. We generate a random rotation angle around the y-axis using `rng.gen_range(0.0..360.0)`.
7. We call the `d-FlowerRed` function with the randomly generated position, rotation, and a fixed scale of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).

This code will generate 10 red flowers randomly placed within the 2x2 grid, with random rotations around the y-axis, and a fixed scale of 1.0 on all axes.

Note: This code assumes that you have imported the necessary crates and defined the `d-FlowerRed` function correctly.
