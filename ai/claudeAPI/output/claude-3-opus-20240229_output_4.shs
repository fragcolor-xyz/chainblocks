	Here's the code to generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid using d-BlockSnowHexagon tiles, starting from x position 4 and z position 4, with the y-axis at -1.0, and offsetting the tile's x position by 0.5 and z position by 0.865:

```python
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        x = 4 + i * 1.5
        z = 4 + j * 1.73
        
        if i % 2 == 1:
            z += 0.865
        
        tile = d.Tile(d.BlockSnowHexagon, position=d.Point(x, -1.0, z))
        d.Place(tile)
```

Explanation:
1. We use nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the 4x4 grid.
2. For each tile, we calculate the x and z positions based on the current row (i) and column (j) indices.
   - The x position is calculated as `4 + i * 1.5`, where 4 is the starting x position, and 1.5 is the horizontal distance between the centers of adjacent tiles in the same row.
   - The z position is calculated as `4 + j * 1.73`, where 4 is the starting z position, and 1.73 is the vertical distance between the centers of adjacent tiles in the same column.
3. To achieve the hexagonal grid pattern, we need to offset the z position of every odd row by half the vertical distance (0.865). We check if the current row index (i) is odd using `i % 2 == 1`, and if true, we add 0.865 to the z position.
4. We create a new tile using `d.Tile(d.BlockSnowHexagon, position=d.Point(x, -1.0, z))`, specifying the block type as `d.BlockSnowHexagon` and setting the position using the calculated x, y, and z coordinates. The y-axis is set to -1.0 for all tiles.
5. Finally, we place the tile in the world using `d.Place(tile)`.

This code will generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid of snow hexagon tiles, starting from the specified position and with the desired offsets to form a cohesive hexagonal pattern.
