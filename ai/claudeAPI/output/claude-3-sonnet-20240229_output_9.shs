	Here's the code to generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid using d-BlockSnowHexagon tiles, starting from x position 4 and z position 4, with the y-axis at -1.0, and offsetting the tile's x position by 0.5 and z position by 0.865 to form a cohesive hexagonal grid:

```lua
-- Define the tile entity
local tile = script:GetCustomEntity("d-BlockSnowHexagon")

-- Set the initial position
local x = 4
local z = 4
local y = -1.0

-- Define the offsets for x and z positions
local xOffset = 0.5
local zOffset = 0.865

-- Loop through rows and columns
for row = 1, 4 do
    for col = 1, 4 do
        -- Calculate the position for the current tile
        local tileX = x + (col - 1) * xOffset
        local tileZ = z + (row - 1) * zOffset

        -- Alternate the offset for even and odd rows
        if row % 2 == 0 then
            tileX = tileX + xOffset / 2
        end

        -- Spawn the tile at the calculated position
        local spawnedTile = tile:Spawn(Vector3.New(tileX, y, tileZ))
    end
end
```

This code will generate a 4x4 hexagonal grid of d-BlockSnowHexagon tiles, starting from x position 4 and z position 4, with the y-axis at -1.0. The tiles will be offset by 0.5 on the x-axis and 0.865 on the z-axis to form a cohesive hexagonal grid.

Note that you need to have the d-BlockSnowHexagon tile entity available in your project for this code to work correctly.
