	Here's the Shards code to generate 10 flowers randomly on a 2x2 grid, starting from x and z position of 1.0 and keeping the y-axis at 0.0:

```
// Create a new scene
let scene = new Scene();

// Set the background color
scene.backgroundColor = Color.white;

// Create 10 flowers
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Generate random x and z positions within the 2x2 grid
    let x = Math.random() * 2 + 1.0;
    let z = Math.random() * 2 + 1.0;
    
    // Create a new flower
    let flower = d_FlowerRed.instantiate();
    
    // Set the position of the flower
    flower.transform.position = new Vector3(x, 0.0, z);
    
    // Add the flower to the scene
    scene.add(flower);
}

// Render the scene
Renderer.render(scene);
```

This code creates a new scene, sets the background color to white, and then generates 10 flowers using a `for` loop. For each flower, it generates a random x and z position within the 2x2 grid, starting from 1.0 on both axes. The y-axis is set to 0.0 to keep the flowers on the ground plane.

The `d_FlowerRed.instantiate()` method is used to create a new flower object, and the `transform.position` property is used to set the position of the flower. Finally, the `scene.add(flower)` method is used to add the flower to the scene, and the `Renderer.render(scene)` method is used to render the scene.

Note that this code assumes that you have already imported the `d_FlowerRed` asset into your Shards project.
