  prompt: """
    How do I create an unassigned constant in Shards.
  """

  solution: {
   Const(value)
  }

  explicit: {
    Const(Value: value)
  }

  explaination: """
    Const declares a constant value (of any data type) by passing it into the parameter :Value. 
    Such a value is usually declared for use as input in other shards.
    A constant value declared with Const is un-named i.e., it is not assigned to any variable or allocated any alias.
