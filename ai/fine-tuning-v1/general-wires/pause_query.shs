    How do I stop a wire from executing momentarily for a period of time
  """

  solution: [{
   @wire(wire{
    Pause(0.5)
   })
  }]

  explicit: [{
   @wire(wire{
    Pause(Time: 0.5)
   })
  }]

  explanation: """
    The Pause shard is a shard that stops a wire from being executed momentarily for a period of time. If the wire is called by a wire 
    Executor Shard within the time frame specified in the Time parameter, it will be ignored.
