    The wire receives 10 flowers spread randomly on the 2x2 grid using d-FlowerRed. 
    The x and z positions are generated using the Random Shard.  Subsequent Math.Add Shards  are used to add float2 inputs with x and z positions of 1.0 
    to the current x and z positions of the flower. The  tiling of x and z is achieved using the Math.Mod Shard.  The generated x and z positions are fed into
    the tile-position of the Set Shard to assign the new position to the flower.
