	Sure. Here is the Shards code block to generate a 6x6 hexagonal grid of 'd-BlockHexagon' tiles.

```shards
0 >= idx 
ForRange(0 35 {   
    idx | ToInt | Math.Divide(6) | ToFloat = row 
    idx | ToInt | Math.Mod(6) | ToFloat  = column 

    row | Math.Mod(2) | ToFloat | Math.Multiply(0.5) = rowOffset

    (column | ToFloat | Math.Multiply(2.0)) | Math.Add(rowOffset) = xPosition
    row | ToFloat | Math.Multiply(0.865) = zPosition

    -1.0 = yPos 

    @f3(xPosition yPos zPosition) = position 

    {Graphics: {"fbl/pose": {translation: position rotation: @f4(0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) scale: @f3(1.0)}}} | Fbl.Formalize("d-BlockHexagon")   
    Math.Inc(idx) 
})
```
This Shards script defines the index range for the loop using 0 for the initial value up to 35. The arrangement of tiles is determined by the row's offset calculated by `row | Math.Mod(2) | ToFloat | Math.Multiply(0.5) = rowOffset`. 

This offset adjusts the x-position of the tiles on alternate rows by 0.5, causing the tiles to align and form a hexagonal pattern. 

The translation is created by `@f3(xPosition yPos zPosition)`, representing the location of each tile in 3D space. 

Finally, the 'd-BlockHexagon' form is materialized with `Fbl.Formalize("d-BlockHexagon")` for each tile's position.
