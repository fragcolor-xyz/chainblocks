	Sure, here is the Shards script that will serve the purpose:

```shards
0 >= idx
ForRange(0 6 { 
  idx | ToFloat | Math.Divide(3.0) | Math.Floor | Math.Add(1.0) = x
  idx | Math.Mod(3) | ToFloat | Math.Add(1.0) = z
  RandomFloat(Max: 1.0) = randomX
  RandomFloat(Max: 1.0) = randomZ
  @f3((x | Math.Add(randomX)) 0.0 (z | Math.Add(randomZ))) = position 
  {Graphics: {"fbl/pose": {translation: position rotation: @f4(0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) scale: @f3(1.0)}}} | Fbl.Formalize("d-TreePine") 
  Math.Inc(idx) 
})
```

Let me explain this a bit.

We initialise our index `idx` with 0 and run a loop for six iterations. For each iteration, we calculate the x and z positions by dividing the current index with 3.0 and then rounding down to the nearest integer with `Math.Floor`. We add 1.0 to ensure that we start from x and z position of 1.0, and to obtain a value between 1 and 4 since our grid is 3x3. 

Next, for a bit randomness in placement, we create two random float numbers `randomX` and `randomZ` that will be added to x and z coordinates.

The result of it is then put into an `@f3` as the translation value for the `Fbl.Formalize` function. We set the rotation and scale values to default.

Finally, we increment `idx` by 1 at the end of each loop.
