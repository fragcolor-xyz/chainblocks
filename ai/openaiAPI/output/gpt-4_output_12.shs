	Here is the Shards script for generating 10 flowers spread randomly in a 2x2 grid:

```shards
0 >= idx
ForRange(0 9 {
   RandomFloat(Max: 2.0) | Math.Add(1.0) = randomX
   RandomFloat(Max: 2.0) | Math.Add(1.0) = randomZ
   @f3(randomX 0.0 randomZ) = position
   {Graphics: {"fbl/pose": {translation: position rotation: @f4(0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) scale: @f3(1.0)}}} | Fbl.Formalize("d-FlowerRed")
   Math.Inc(idx)
})
```

* The above script initializes an index ('idx') for our loop, which will create the desired amount of flowers (10 in this case).
* We then enter a loop (ForRange), which will run from our starting index 0 to 9 (10 iterations total).
* For each iteration, we generate a random float number between 0.0 and 2.0 for both x-axis ('randomX') and z-axis ('randomZ'). We then add 1.0 to each value to ensure we start from an x and z position of 1.0.
* We create a 3D vector 'position' for each flower using the random x and z values, and keep y-axis constant at 0.0. 
* Then we create a form with that position, a default rotation using quaternion, and a scale of 1 in all directions.
* The form for each flower is then finalized with the function 'Fbl.Formalize' using the identifier 'd-FlowerRed'
* Lastly, we increment the index ('idx') for the next iteration. This is repeated until we have created 10 flowers.
