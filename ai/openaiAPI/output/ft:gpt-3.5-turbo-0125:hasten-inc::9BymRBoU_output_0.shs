    The Tree Shard is a Shard that spawns objects (from a sequence or a single object) and gives them the  Name: provided in the Name: parameter. 
    They type of object spawned is defined in the Prefab: parameter. 
    The  Position: of the spawned object is determined by the value passed into the Position: parameter.
    Generally, the Tree Shard is used in conjunction with the ForRange Shard to spawn several objects. It will also wire 
    the objects spawned with its Wire: parameter.
