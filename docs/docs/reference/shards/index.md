# Shards reference

Welcome to the Shards reference docs. This is where you can access comprehensive information about every shard, enum, and Lisp function that has been defined in Shards. 

Shards is a programming language that helps developers create complex workflows easily. It does this by breaking the code into small functional units called shards, which can be connected with other shards to create bigger workflows. Each shard can be adjusted to meet specific needs by using parameters. These parameters and specific traits of each shard can be found within our API docs.

Begin your journey by selecting the section you wish to navigate to:

- [Overview](./overview/)

- [Shards](./shards/)

- [Enums](./enums/)

- [Lisp functions](./lisp/)

Alternatively, you can search for a specific shard or function by utilizing the search bar above.
