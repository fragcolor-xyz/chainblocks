# Lisp Functions

Lisp functions are used in Shards for templating and writing macros.

Templates can be defined for a common task that is used frequently in the program. This template can then be reused throughout the program, saving time and effort. This allow developers to create complex code structures that are reusable and easily maintainable. The templates can include placeholders for values that are determined at run-time, making them highly versatile.
