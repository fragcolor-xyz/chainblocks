# Enums

This section serves as a reference guide for all the [enum](../shards/types/#enum) constants available within the Shards programming language. An enum, short for enumeration, is a set of named values, and enum constants are the individual values within that set. In Shards, enums are used to define a fixed set of values that can be used in the program.
