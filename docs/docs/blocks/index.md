# Introduction

Chainblocks aims to be a meta language or a visual language rather then a pure programming language. To nicely describe
chains and the data they contain, we adopt a simple language based on EDN and Clojure.

Notice that in theory any language can be used, this was just a pragmatic choice. In fact you will also find chains written in C++ digging the Chainblocks codebase.

One can think of it as a comprehensible JSON on steroids that can be evaluated or the Ansible of general programming.

The execution of Chainblocks scripts is meant to be fast: the scripting language is just a description of the computational graph.
The runtime itself is completely detached.

## Some examples

### Super simple example

**Code**

```clojure
; define a node
(defnode main)
; define a simple hello world looped chain
(defloop hello-world
  (Msg "Hello world"))
; schedule the chain for exection
(schedule main hello-world)
; run the node at 1 second intervals
(run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
```

**Output**

```shell
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:22.290] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:23.299] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:24.291] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:25.289] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:26.291] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:27.299] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:28.296] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:29.292] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:30.295] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:31.298] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
[info] [2021-04-04 16:43:32.298] [T-148944] [logging.cpp::94] [hello-world] Hello world
```

### Another example

**Code**

```clojure
; define a node
(defnode main)
; define a simple counter looped chain
(defloop counter
  ; Setup runs only once at chain start
  (Setup
   0 >= .counter)
  ; get counter variable and print
  .counter (Log)
  ; increase the counter
  (Math.Inc .counter)
  ; notice that Math.Inc will passthrough the value
  ; so the value will be before increment
  ; if we wanted to pick up the increment uncomment the next line
  ; .counter
  (When (Is 10) (Stop)))
; schedule the chain for exection
(schedule main counter)
; run the node at 1 second intervals
(run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
```

**Output**

```shell
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:43.045] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 0
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:44.055] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 1
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:45.058] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 2
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:46.057] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 3
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:47.049] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 4
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:48.057] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 5
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:49.046] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 6
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:50.049] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 7
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:51.058] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 8
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:52.054] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 9
[info] [2021-04-04 19:00:53.055] [T-244992] [logging.cpp::53] [counter] 10
```

### A more complex example

Showing how we mix the Clojure-like language as a template language

**Code**

```clojure
; define a node
(defnode main)
; define a counter template
(defn make-counter [start]
  ; this time we use the Chain symbol as we want to make a function
  (Chain
   ; customize the chain's name
   (str "counter-" start) :Looped
   ; Setup runs only once at chain start
   (Setup
    ; set start with the start function argument
    start >= .counter)
   ; get counter variable and print
   .counter (Log)
   ; increase the counter
   (Math.Inc .counter)
   ; notice that Math.Inc will passthrough the value
   ; so the value will be before increment
   ; if we wanted to pick up the increment uncomment the next line
   ; .counter
   ; also at chain definition time compute the end value
   ; (+) is not a block, it will be evaluated only once when composing the chain
   (When (Is (+ start 10)) (Stop))))
; schedule 2 chains for exection
(schedule main (make-counter 0))
(schedule main (make-counter 10))
; run the node at 1 second intervals
(run main 1.0) ; <-- execution will block here
```

**Output**

```shell
[info] [2021-04-04 21:05:40.121] [T-285088] [logging.cpp::53] [counter-0] 0
