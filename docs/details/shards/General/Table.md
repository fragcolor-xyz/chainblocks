`Table` creates an empty table with or without a specified key (via the `Key:` parameter). The created table name is defined in the `Name:` parameter.

Whether the created table variable has a global scope (available to all wires on the mesh) or a local scope (available only to the wire its defined in) can be controlled via the `Global:` parameter (`true` for global scope, `false` for local scope; default is `false`).

In addition to the key and the scope, this shard can also define the table's inner data types via the `Types:` parameter. More than one data type may be set.

Any input to this shard is ignored and instead passed through as its output.
