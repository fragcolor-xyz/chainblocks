`Swap` swaps the values of the two variables passed to it, one via the `NameA:` parameter, the other via the `NameB:` parameter.

This shard works on all kinds of variables and across types. So you can not only swap between two integers, two strings, two sequences, two tables etc., but also between a string and a number, a table and a sequence and so on.

Any input to this shard is ignored and instead passed through as its output.
