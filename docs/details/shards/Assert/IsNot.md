 In this shard, it is the inequality that is asserted. This means that the assertion is considered successful only if the input given does **not** match the `Value` parameter of this shard.

The rest of the shard's behavior (including the impact of the value of the `Abort` parameter) is identical to [`Assert.Is`](../Is) and can be used for writing inline unit tests.
