Lerp stands for Linear Interpolation, which is a mathematical technique used to determine a value between two endpoints based on a given factor or weight.

In simple terms, Lerp takes three values:

1. A start value

2. An end value

3. A fraction or weight

Lerp returns a value that is some proportion between those two values. This proportion is determined by the fraction or weight value given. This value is usually represented as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the start value, and 1 represents the end value. For example, if we use 0.5 as the weight value, we would get an output that is exactly halfway between the start and end values given.

The formula for Lerp is as follows:

`startValue + weight * (endValue - startValue)`

Lerp is commonly used in computer graphics and animation to smoothly interpolate between two values over time, creating fluid transitions and animations.
