Multiplication is a binary operation, i.e., it needs two arguments to give a result.

The `Math.Multiply` shard takes in the **Input** and the parameter `Operand:` to produce the **Output**.

Both **Input** and `Operand:` can be an integer, a float, or a sequence of such entities (but both value types should match for a given operation). The **Output** is generally of the same type as the **Input** provided to the shard.
