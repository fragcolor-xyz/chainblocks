`Math.Exp` calculates the exponential value of a given number.

The `Math.Exp` shard takes a value which is passed to the exponential function. The output of the `Math.Exp` shard is the exponential value of the input.

The exponential value of a number is defined as `e` raised to the power of the input number, where `e` is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. So, for example, if the input to the `Math.Exp` shard is `x`, then the output value will be `e^x`.
