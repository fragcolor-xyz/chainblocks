## Source code editor for Shards

This directory contains an editor configured to highlight Shards syntax. The editor is primarily used to debug syntax highlighting of Shards new syntax.

Use the following command to run the Shards editor:
```sh
shards new run-editor.shs
```

To debug syntax highlighting of Shards new syntax, copy+paste code into the editor.

The file for syntax highlighting the new Shards syntax is located in [../shards/modules/egui/src/widgets/code_editor/sublime-syntax.yml](../shards/modules/egui/src/widgets/code_editor/sublime-syntax.yml).
